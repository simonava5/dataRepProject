This project shows my understanding of REST API.
I created a web interface where you can view my program which works from a local machine.

What is **REST API**?

A REST API defines a set of functions which developers can perform requests and receive responses via HTTP protocol such as GET and POST.

This program includes
* A database table
* CRUD operations
* Authorisation

How to **run** it?

1. Save all files on a local machine.
2. Run simpleserver.py on your command prompt.
3. Open files through local machine
*http://127.0.0.1:5000/*
4. Database table is in the **CustomerList.html** file.
