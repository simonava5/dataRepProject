This project shows my understanding of REST API.
I created a web interface where you can view my program which works from a local machine.

What is **REST API**?

A REST API defines a set of functions which developers can perform requests and receive responses via HTTP protocol such as GET and POST.

This program includes
* A database table
* CRUD operations
* Authorisation
